Fractalism is a state ideology and ontology that says that every being is in a great chain and has its rightful place.

- Effects on imports
  - Raw resources: after all, we must grow the fractal!
  - Stars: after all, stars are a plentiful source of energy
  - Gas Giants: after all, gas giants are plentiful in resources... albeit rather raw and useless in their raw form.
- effects on exports
  - virches: they could make a fine living creating epic art. of course they don't need to because space is plentiful in resources, but they could! mostly just with modosophonts though.
  - narratives:
