* ideas on the original "perseus princes expansion"
- @Nyeti and @Grawa427 said that they prefer it to be on the same page as the Pluton Volume because it being implemented by other polities would reduce its uniqueness. I think they are wrong; Negentropism and Zoeticisim are unique to their empires yet have their own pages. I think we should make one for this so that the article can thus include more detail about Fractalism's history without bogging down the Pluton Volume's page.
